//! Loading user applications into memory
//!
//! For chapter 3, user applications are simply part of the data included in the
//! kernel binary, so we only need to copy them to the space allocated for each
//! app to load them. We also allocate fixed spaces for each task's
//! [`KernelStack`] and [`UserStack`].
